A P5JS framework for running a simple music visualizer, intended as a creative coding I assignment.

## Usage
This visualiser is deployed [here](https://23-2-dsdn142.github.io/the-music-visualizer-DjCrqss/).
You can move your mouse to the top left and click the button to play the song.

## Changes
I have edited the system_runner.js to allow extra smoothing of one of the channels. 

Song details: 
Title = Space Cadet
Artist = Metro Boomin and Gunna
